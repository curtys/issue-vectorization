            "body": "Hi Peter, \n\nCouple comments.  #1 makes sense, except the super.score() part, the score from the other part of the matching is handled by the nonPayloadExpl part.  I do agree it should check for zero on payloadsSeen, though, and have added that.\n\nI don't think I am understanding the issue with #2 above.  I am not sure the test is correct.  The results[0] being passed into the checkHitCollector say you expect Document 0 to be a match, but this can't be since the boost is 0, therefore there are no results.  This can be seen by running the query against the search without the explain, as in:\nTopDocs hits = searcher.search(query, null, 100);\nassertTrue(\"hits Size: \" + hits.totalHits + \" is not: \" + 0, hits.totalHits == 0);\n\nOr, perhaps I am missing something?  I guess I don't see why the boost part needs to be in there?  Can't you have a test that has no payloads?\n",

If you do a similar test with TermQuery (with a field boost = 0) instead of BoostingTermQuery, you'll see the difference. Even terms with 0 weight are included in the explanation. Make sense?\n\nPeter\n\n",

    "description": "There are a couple of minor bugs in BoostingTermQuery.explain().\n\n1. The computation of average payload score produces NaN if no payloads were found. It should probably be:\nfloat avgPayloadScore = super.score() * (payloadsSeen > 0 ? (payloadScore / payloadsSeen) : 1);\n\n2. If the average payload score is zero, the value of the explanation is 0:\nresult.setValue(nonPayloadExpl.getValue() * avgPayloadScore);\nIf the query is part of a BooleanClause, this results in:\n\"no match on required clause...\"\n\"failure to meet condition(s) of required/prohibited clause(s)\"\n\nThe average payload score can be zero if the field boost = 0.\n\nI've attached a patch to 'TestBoostingTermQuery.java', however, the test 'testNoPayload' fails in 'SpanScorer.score()' because the doc = -1. It looks like 'setFreqCurrentDoc() should have been called before 'score()'. Maybe someone more knowledgable of spans could investigate this.\n",
