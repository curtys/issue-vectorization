    "description": "The documentation specifies the digest algorithms which can be used to avoid \nstoring plain text passwords. Unfortunately passwords are strings and the input of \ndigest algorithms are bytes, but the conversion between the two - the charset \nencoding to be used - is not specified. \n\nLooking at the source of org.apache.tomcat.modules.aaa.RealmBase it turns out that \nit uses the system default charset encoding, which is usually a bad idea for a \nserver software. E.g. moving the server to another machine or using a second \nserver with different locale renders the user database invalid. \n\nThe best solution would be to explicitly specify an encoding, e.g. UTF-8. But at \nthis moment this may break existing configurations. Another solution is to add an \nadditional parameter to each realm implementation and the command line utility, in \nwhich the administrator can specify the encoding. The default of this parameter \nmust be \"encode using the platform's default charset\", in order to not break \ncompatiblity.",
