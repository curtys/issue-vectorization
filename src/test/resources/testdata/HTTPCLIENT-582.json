            "body": "Hi Sebastian,\n\nWe can avoid the creation of some temporary objects by changing your patch as follows:\n- create the ArrayList with appropriate size (SPECS.size(), in case there is no DEFAULT)\n- create the array for the toArray call with appropriate size (list.size())\n\nWould you mind adding a description to the JavaDocs, for the overview pages?\n\"Obtains the registered cookie policy names.\" or something like that.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's worth the trouble to strip the DEFAULT policy from the result.\n  return (String[]) SPECS.keySet().toArray(new String [SPECS.size()]);\nlooks so much simpler. And you can check whether the default policy is registered.\nIt should be, but it can be deregistered.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",

We should\njust agree on one behavior and implement that. I don't have strong\nfeelings about it, so if you prefer to remove the default, go with it.\nBut you should be aware that a custom cookie spec might be\nregistered only as the default and not with an explicit name.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
