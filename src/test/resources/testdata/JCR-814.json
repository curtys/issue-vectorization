The fix is to override the checkSchema in the OracleBundlePersistenceManager, with the fix of Tobias for the metaData.getTables call. I guess that the issue should be reopenend, but I am not allowed to do that.\n\nRegards,\n\nMartijn Hendriks\n\n",

    "description": "When using the OracleBundlePersistenceManager there is an issue when two users use the same database for persistence. In  that case, the checkSchema() method of the BundleDbPersistenceManager  does not work like it should. More precisely, the call \"metaData.getTables(null,  null, tableName, null);\" will also includes table names of other  schemas/users. Effectively, only the first user of a database is able to create  the schema.\n\nprobably same issue as here: JCR-582",
