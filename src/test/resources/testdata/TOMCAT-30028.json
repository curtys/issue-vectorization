The Developer has the responsibility for\nsynchronizing access to session resources as appropriate.\n\n</quote>\n\nI wouldnt say this implies that HttpSession is not guaranteed to be thread-safe\nand to be fair it is quite ambiguous about either. As to my interpretation the\nspec is talking about objects that are stored in session. And it would be\nlogical because the container cannot possibly synchronize access to them.\n\nThe session itself is a different matter altogether. It is a container resource\nand I dont think it would qualify as a \"session resource\" the spec is going on\nabout. I would say that the container have to synchronize calls to\nsetAttribute/removeAttribute to ensure session consistency.\n\nPerformance difference between HashMap and the synchronized map is negligible\nand the advantages are obvious. Basically unless session is accessed by the\nsingle servlet implementing SingleThreadModel there is no way to gurantee\nsession connsistency? Even <jsp:useBean> does not synchronize against the\nsession. So everyone is a winner if StandardSession.attributes is synchronized?\n\nI do hope that what i said here makes sense because Tomcat is one of the few\nservers that doesnt care about setAttribute/removeAttribute thread safety, which\nis a shame.\n\nRegards,\nVlad\n",

Moreover the spec is saying about \"session resources\".\n\nGiven that the sync problem is *easy* to rectify on the container side with no\nside effects it is a reasonable thing to do. I dont mind calling it an\nenhancement either.\n\nCluster problem you described is a different matter. If you use \"sticky\" load\nbalancing you wouldnt have experienced that.\n\nVlad",

This caused\nStandardSession.keys() to throw NoSuchElement exception and serialization for\nthat session to be broken permanently. That in its turn caused cluster to become\ninconsistent and so on.\n\nI do appreciate that the relevant synchronization is expected to be done by\ndevelopers but it is not always possible to enforce that. Some software we use\nis either close-source obfuscated type, or a big project developed and tested by\na third party on a different application server. Either way existing sites dont\nwork properly on Tomcat and we are not in a position to rewrite/modify the code\nto make those sites more \"intellegent\" so to speak.\n\nAnyway, i would like to suggest a fix to StandardSession.java:\n\n34a35,36\n> import java.util.Collections;\n> import java.util.Map;\n119,120c121\n<     protected HashMap attributes = new HashMap();\n< \n---\n>     protected Map attributes = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap());\n\nThis is a patch for the 5.0.27 source.\n\nThanks,\nVlad",
