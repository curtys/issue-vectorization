    "description": "Since creating the docMap is expensive, and it's only used during segment merging, not searching, defer creation until it is requested.\n\nSegmentMergeInfo is also used in MultiTermEnum, the term enumerator for a MultiReader.  TermEnum is used by queries such as PrefixQuery, RangeQuery, WildcardQuery, as well as RangeFilter, DateFilter, and sorting the first time (filling the FieldCache).\n\nPerformance Results:\n  A simple single field index with 555,555 documents, and 1000 random deletions was queried 1000 times with a PrefixQuery matching a single document.\n\nPerformance Before Patch:\n  indexing time = 121,656 ms\n  querying time = 58,812 ms\n\nPerformance After Patch:\n  indexing time = 121,000 ms\n  querying time =         598 ms\n\nA 100 fold increase in query performance!\n\nAll lucene unit tests pass.",
